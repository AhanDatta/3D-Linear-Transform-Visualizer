I originally made this program to help me explain the geometric intuitions behind linear algebra to a friend of mine. I hope it can be helpful for other people to do the same. 
Note that the program works for any set of starting vectors, so it can be used to demonstrate how change of basis works as well. All you have to do is change e_1, e_2.

USAGE:
To change the matrix which you want to visualize, open up the excel file and input the numbers you from A2-C4. The program does NOT iterpret empty space as a zero, so if an entry is zero, write it explicitly. 
To change the starting vectors, you can change e_1, e_2, and e_3, and the rest of the animation will work.
